Entity summarization is the problem of identifying a limited number of ordered RDF triples that summarize an entity in the best wayâ€”the result is typically presented in knowledge panels.

## LinkSUM - Awesome!
Currently, LinkSUM and the WDAqua SummaServer are the only entity summarization systems freely available:

* <https://km.aifb.kit.edu/services/link/>
* <https://km.aifb.kit.edu/services/summaServer/> (SUMMA API reference implementation, source code <https://github.com/athalhammer/summaServer>)

This boils down to the following **endpoints**:
* DBpedia - <https://km.aifb.kit.edu/services/link/sum>
* DBpedia - <https://km.aifb.kit.edu/services/summaServer/sum>
All of these endpoints comply to the SUMMA API and can be consumed with the summaClient implementation:

**Demos**:

A demo which combines the DBpedia Spotlight entity linking and LinkSUM entity summarization can be found here:
